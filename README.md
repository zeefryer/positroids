# Positroids
Python code for computation with positroids, totally nonnegative matrices, Wilson loop diagrams, and H-primes.

Uses Python 2.7 and Sympy 1+. Definitely not Python 3 compatible.

Note: When we used this code for our paper on 2,6 Wilson loop diagrams, we were using Sage for the homology computations which was still on Python 2.6 and wasn't directly compatible. To get the data into Sage (e.g. for homology computations), you need to export the data into a text file and then import that into Sage. See 2_6_data.py for examples.

For the code used to obtain [the results on 2,6 Wilson loop diagrams](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00958), see `2_6_data.py`.


### Caveats
This code was written many years ago, long before I learned to write good code and back when the prevailing wisdom was "sure, Python 3 exists but it's not stable yet, just stick to Python 2.7". 

The code is preserved here both because it might be less annoying for people doing computations to use this code than write their own, and also as a companion to [arXiv:1803.00958](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00958) which used this code to obtain many of the results.

On the plus side, these functions have by this point been extensively tested on examples, so any bugs should be of the big obvious crashing kind rather than the subtle "just quietly gives the wrong answer" kind.


### To use
Import positroids.py in your Python shell for interactive computation with the functions listed below.

```python

from positroids import *
from sympy import *

# Syntax
########

# WLD: (n,[[vertices of prop 1],[vertices of prop 2],...])
# Le diagram: Matrix([[row 1],[row 2]....])
# GN: [[I1],[I2],...]
# Permutations: written in truncated 2 line notation, i.e. [3,2,4,1] is the permutation that maps 1 -> 3, 2 -> 2, 3 -> 4, 4 -> 1.

### Example:
# A 6 vertex WLD with propagators (1,3) and (3,5):
W = (6, [[1, 2, 3, 4], [3, 4, 5, 6]])

# Its Le diagram is
Matrix([[0,1,1,1],[1,1,1,x]]) 
# (the x denotes a missing square, i.e. the diagram is not rectangular)

# Its Grassmann necklace is
[[1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5], [5, 1], [6, 1]]

# Its decorated permutation is
[2,4,5,1,6,3]



########
# A few miscellaneous functions
########


Aq2(k,n) 
#	This counts how many Le diagrams of each dimension there are in Gr(k,n)
#	The coefficient of q^i is how many cells of dimension i there are.

allLe(k,n,dim)
#	This generates all Le diagrams in Gr(k,n)
#	If dim = False (this is the default) then the output is a list
#	If dim = True, output is a dictionary, key i produces list of all i-dim Le diagrams

LetoLatex(M)
#	Turns a Le diagram M into a string containing the tex code for that diagram
# (current formatting is for ytableau package)


allWLD(k,n):
#	Generates all WLD of size (k,n)
#	The syntax for a WLD is (n,[P1,P2,...,Pk]) where each P is a list P=[i,i+1,j,j+1] listing the propagator's support


##########
# Now lots of functions for converting between the various objects:
##########

WLDtoGr(W):
#	turns a WLD into an elt of Gr(k,n)

WLDtoGN(W):
#	turns a WLD into a Grassmann necklace

WLDtoDP(W):
#	turns a WLD into a decorated permutation

WLDtoLe(W):
#	turns a WLD into its Le diagram

GrtoGN(M):
#	turns a TNN element of Gr(k,n) into its Grassmann necklace

GrtoDP(M):
#	turns a TNN element of Gr(k,n) into its decorated permutation

GrtoLe(M):
#	turns a TNN element of Gr(k,n) into its Le diagram

GNtoDP(I):
#	turns a Grassmann necklace into a decorated permutation




########
# Some functions for computing reduced words and boundaries
########

LetoRP(L,n)
#	L is the Le diagram, n is whatever dimension you're in, i.e. the n in Gr(k,n)
#	This turns a Le diagram into a reduced permutation, needed for boundaries
#	Output is a pair of permutations (V,W) corresponding to the pair of permutations defining the cell


isbound(V,W,V1,W1,k):
#	Used to check whether one cell is on the boundary of another
#	Specify permutations attached to two Le diagrams, i.e. LetoRP(L1,n) = (V,W) and LetoRP(L2,n) = (V1,W1)
#	Also specify k, i.e the k in whichever Gr(k,n) you're working in
#	This function returns True iff L2 lies on the boundary of L1, i.e. (V1,W1) lies on the boundary of (V,W)




###########
# Example of computing boundaries in Gr(k,n)
###########


### first set your values of k,n and define the WLD

k,n = 2,6
W = ## define your WLD here ## 
V1 = WLDtoLe(W)



V1RP = LetoRP(V1,n)

AL = allLe(k,n,False)
ALRP = [LetoRP(M,n) for M in AL]

## lists are ordered, so ALRP[i] is the reduced permutation of the Le diagram AL[i]

# produce all bounds of V1
boundsV1 = [AL[i] for i in range(len(AL)) if isbound(V1RP[0],V1RP[1],ALRP[i][0],ALRP[i][1],k)]


# pick out just the d-dim ones
d = 5
[M for M in boundsV1 if flatten(M).count(1) == d]
